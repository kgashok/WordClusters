**Workship**: "Every work that we do... every thought that we think, leaves such an impression on the mind-stuff..." - Swami Vivekananda

_A huge responsibility for every leader who is accountable for establishing the right culture/behavior/values in any work environment, thriving or otherwise._

##The Need of the Hour: More Performance

The need of the hour is Performance. Performance in the face of increasing competition from all sides. And believe me, the competition is extremely fierce as well. Performance can be had only if every one puts in their share of hard work. Let's not beat around the bush. This is the cold hard fact. Find peace in performing (for yourself first, your team and your company). Not the hard work that emanates not from more scrutiny, or micro-management but from discretionary output. What is discretionary output? The "extra" that employees contribute out of their own volition, will or wish. 

Discretionary output happens when there is "Alignment" in values. Values between what the organisation wants and what the individual wants. What are those values? There is only one end value: Peace through Workship (Seiyyum Tholilae Deivam). It is the attitude with which we approach the customer as God. And our intent is to ensure that we cause him "no evil", "no sorrow". We also very keen to help him win. We make promises, we keep promises.  We ensure every customer engagement produces a reference-able customer. We seek to perform at our best (not focusing on the end result or the fruit in mind). We find peace (now and forever) when we go to bed at night, fully knowing that we have done justice to our duty. We generate more peace for ourselves through Workship.

Two important "means" values that aid in causing "Workship" - and that is 
  - Love for Improvement (the daily, accelerated, continuous kind)
    - Important question: What would it be like if you could improve 1% every day? 
    - Big Goals. Incremental goals. Goals of the third kind. (Ambition, regardless of your past, are you aware of the baby elephant syndrome?)
    - Focus, focus (if you have two priorities, you are already running after two rabbits, and probably don't have a choice. If you have three, you actually don't have any priorities).
    - Self improvement - through 3M - make commitments, monitor behavior, modify behaviour

  - Happiness and Camaraderie through "No arrogance" - Nothing worthwhile today is possible without the Highest Teamwork (Humility is at the root of this)
      - What are the strong opinions you are weakly holding on to? What are the weak opinions you are strongly holding on to?
      - Cordiality is not an option. First, like yourself. How much do you like yourself as a person? Remember, KG is a place for you and your colleagues to be happily successful. We want to accomplish something great and don't care who gets the recognition.
      - If you seriously think someone does not belong in your environment, speak to him privately. Tell him why you feel so. And if he still doesn't change, escalate it to your supervisor. And ask him to escalate it to me, if he too feels the same. Get rid of the virus, before we all get infected and die.
      - We are actually doing him a disservice by asking him not to go find his true calling. And who knows, he might actually turn around and thank you for it.

---
Attitude - of duty of service to God through customer, to love, to find peace in Workship
