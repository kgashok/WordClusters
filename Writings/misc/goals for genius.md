### Transforming Genius within through Goal Orientation
_The most powerful answer to KITE's CMQ_

The idea presented here is this: Choose to become intensely focused on *one* (preferably) or more goals to achieve maximum transformation. 

  - IntenseToInsane (**I2I**)
  - Become **`Intense`** about something!
    - intense about information (inquiry), or innovation or inspiration or inclusiveness!
    - Become intensely involved to become insanely great!
      - learn to be like this while you are at KITE, and definitely before you leave!
      
- __Gold medal__ (amass information through inquiry)
- __Hacker__ (amass innovation through projects) 
- __Ideator__ (amass inspiration through voice/blogs/communication)
- __ChangeMaker__ (amass inclusiveness through service, compassion campaigns)
- __Entrepreneur/ CareerChaser/ Scientist/ HE_Learner__ 
  - (some combination of all of the above)
     for e.g if you want to go to UT Dallas MS program 
       - 8.0 CGPA is preferable, and technical extra-curricular activities are also important!

Choose one, and choose well
  - What gets your juices going? Sleep on it! 
  - What do your friends want you to do?
    - but do find like-minded guys to jointly do things
      - Have fun pursuing meaningful things, not movie watching!
  - What do your parents want you to do?
  
### Can I can change my mind, midway?
  - Preferably, no. 
    - But the earlier you commit, the better the success
    - But choose **one** of the above and be intense about it right away! 
      - It is okay to default to "Gold Medal" before choosing something else

###Related notes from HaikuDeck 
  - Forward is the only way to go, isn't it? You are the Master of your Destiny, Yoga Vashista said that to Lord Rama. And that's also the case with you. Glory is your birthright, go grab it. Be inspired by the genius within you. Have fun along the way!
  - Focus is the one word that Bill Gates and Warren Buffet coincided as required for success. Gain information through proper inquiry
  - Flow requires commitment to Habits (regular rhythm), creativity, innovation and the willingness to fail fast, so you may succeed faster
  - Have faith in yourself, so you will persevere even in the face of setbacks. Help others, connect with others, bring a lot of passion to whatever you do, and that makes you a leader.
  - Leaders are in demand, at all levels of society. Lead yourself first, and help lead others! 

### Final word: Urgency, Genius and Steve Jobs
"The difference isn't resources," Gladwell said. "It's attitude."" http://buff.ly/1svwLFL

"Jobs has a sense of urgency," Gladwell said. "He wants to do it now. He speeds to Cupertino and says, drop everything, we're doing this at this very moment." Meanwhile people at Xerox, with their unlimited time and money, think that genius can't be rushed. Jobs is rushed - he's urgent - and that was a part of his genius.

"The difference isn't resources," Gladwell said. "It's attitude."
