_If you want to really communicate to the hugely distracted, heavily diluted, undisciplined decadent youth in this world, use as little words as possible._

# Conviction (courage)

    - I am the Leader everyone has been waiting for
        - Ask. Believe. Receive.
        - If you don't believe yourself, even God can't help you - Vivekananda

# Discipline (focus, Concentration)

    - show me some discipline, motherfucker
        - show me your Shiny Gold Medal
        - a sign of amassing information - which is good

# Passion (Curiosity, Commitment)

    - show me some passion, motherfucker
        - tell me you beat my Code complexity challenge (Karumanchi)

# Peace (faith, character)
