        - Ask. Believe. Receive.
        - If you don't believe yourself, even God can't help you - Vivekananda

    - show me some discipline, motherfucker
        - show me your shiny Gold Medal

# Passion (Curiosity, Commitment)

    - show me some passion, motherfucker
        - tell me you beat my Code complexity challenge (Karumanchi)
# Creativity (flow, fail fast)

    - show me your iMINT portfolio, motherfucker
        - tell me your won the Innocentive Challenge or
        - Solved a real problem in a real situation

# Peace (faith, character)
_What does your inner soul really [desire][innerDesire]? Have you really tried listening to it? Why not?_
