Business as usual has become increasingly unsustainable.

For us to strive thrive and survive
* we need to have powerful values and those values have to propel us into a more exciting and sustainable future
* more import than strategy
* street smartness
* business model - race to the bottom
* culture
* behaviour

That's what has knowingly or unknowingly brought us together as a working unit and will need to continue to do As we climb steeper mountains and deeper valleys - and encourage other like-minded people to join in

WINNING values
* only one - end
* two enablers
Workship
Seiyyum tholilae Deivam
* integrity, improvement and innovation, inspiration
* reject mediocrity absolutely
________________________
Improvement, the technology-enabled kind
* ambitious - 37.8% or 37.8? Leadership has to be the role model here
________________________
No arrogance - teamwork is another amplifier
* no room for Assholes here, alright!
* humility

Why KG and not Kumaraguru?
* values/ passion are stronger and that only time will tell - a team which believes this more than anything
* we are in the right segments - education, healthcare and infra and energy - we are going global
* challenges are huge / service sector needs both I And N
________________________
* we are wanting to do it NOW
* * not in 10 years - otherwise we cannot survive - crisis situation brings out the best in the team
* we are young and malleable - and still strong enough not to be impeded by constraints - access to funds - healthcare CSR for example
